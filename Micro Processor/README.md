### Questions--


#### 1. Addition of immediate 8 bit numbers
`Write a program to add the numbers 32H and 42H and save the result in accumulator`
#### 2. Subtraction of immediate 8 bit numbers
`Write a program to substract the numbers 42H from 24H and save the result in accumulator`
#### 3. Addition of 8 bit numbers stored in memory location
`Write a program to add the content of memory location 9100H and 9101H and store the result in the memory location 9102H`
#### 4. Block transfer of data in memory segments far apart
`6 bytes of data are stored in memory starting from 8000H. Write a program to Move the block of data to memory address starting from 9001H`
#### 5. Block transfer of data in memory segments overlapping each other
`6 bytes of data are stored in memory starting from 6000H to 6005H. Write a program to Move the block of data to memory address starting from 6003H to 6008H`
#### 6. Addition of an array of bytes stored in consecutive memory
`6 bytes of data are stored in memory location starting from 3001H to 3005H. Write a program to add the data bytes and store the result LSB in 3009H and MSB in 3008H(use register B to store if any carry is generated)`
#### 7. Addition of unknown number of bytes stored in consecutive memory 
`Certain numbers of bytes of data ae stored in memory location starting at 9100H. Number of bytes are unknown. End of the data sting is indicate by 00H. Add all the data bytes, use register B to save any carry generated while adding consecutive memory location. Store the result MSB in 9200H and LSB in 9201H`
#### 8. Addition of two 16 bit numbers stored in memory
`1st 16 bit number - LSB in 9200H,MSB in 9201H ; 2nd 16 bit number - LSB in 9300H,MSB in 9301H ; add the two number and save the result LSB in 9302H and MSB in 9303H`
#### 9. Subtraction of two 16 bit numbers stored in memory 
`1st 16 bit number - LSB in 9200H,MSB in 9201H ; 2nd 16 bit number - LSB in 9300H,MSB in 9301H ; substract the 1st number from 2nd one and save the result LSB in 9302H and MSB in 9303H`
#### 10. Multiplication of two 8 bit unsigned numbers stored in memory 
`Write a program to multiply a number stored in memory location 9100H by another number stored in memory location 9101H and store the result in memory location 9102H`
#### 11. Division of one 8 bit unsigned number by another 8 bit unsigned number stored in memory
